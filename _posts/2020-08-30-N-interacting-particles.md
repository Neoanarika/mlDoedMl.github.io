## Basic problem setup

Consider $N$ indistinguishable point particles, and denote by $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $v_i âˆˆ \mathbb{R}^n$ the position and momentum of particle number i.

In the classical case of Newton dynamics, the positions $x_i$, sometimes written as  $q_i$ to indicate generalise coordinate systems and momenta $p_i$ satisfy

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
